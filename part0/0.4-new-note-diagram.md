    participant server

    Note right of browser: User writes text in the input field and clicks "Save" button

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note
    activate server
    Note left of server: Server saves the new note and responds with HTTP 302 redirect
    server-->>browser: HTTP 302 Found (Location: /exampleapp/notes)
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: Browser follows the redirect and reloads the notes page

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "new note", "date": "2025-11-02" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes including the new one
```

## Explanation of the process:

1. **User action**: User types text into the form field and clicks the "Save" button
2. **POST request**: Browser sends a POST request to `/new_note` endpoint with the form data
3. **Server processing**: Server receives the data, saves the new note, and responds with HTTP 302 redirect
4. **Redirect**: Browser automatically follows the redirect to `/exampleapp/notes`
5. **Page reload**: The entire page loading process repeats:
   - HTML document is fetched
   - CSS file is loaded
   - JavaScript file is loaded
   - JavaScript executes and fetches the updated JSON data (now including the new note)
   - Notes are rendered on the page

The key difference from simply loading the page is the initial POST request that submits the new note data to the server.
